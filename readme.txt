Validations weren't added due to time constraints so allocation of task to worker only works if a task has been allocated other wise there is key error.
For allocating the task the task, asset and available worker can be selected using the dropdown menu which shows the data that has been added already. (It needs to be added after running the program)

The program uses list and dictionary to store the data, couldn't convert it to add the databse functionality because of time constraint. 
The data wipes off after the server is shut down.
